3.8.6 (unreleased)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


3.8.5 (2011-09-13)
------------------

- fixed bug: requests lasting over 15 minutes were sometimes closed
  prematurely.

3.8.4 (2011-06-07)
------------------

- Fix syntax error in tests on Python < 2.6.


3.8.3 (2011-05-18)
------------------

- Made ``start_response`` method of WSGI server implementation more compliant
  with spec:

    http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/#the-start-response-callable

3.8.2 (2010-12-04)
------------------

- Corrected license version in ``zope/server/http/tests/test_wsgiserver.py``.

3.8.1 (2010-08-24)
------------------

- When the result of a WSGI application was received, ``task.write()`` was
  only called once to transmit the data. This prohibited the transmission of
  partial results. Now the WSGI server iterates through the result itself
  making multiple ``task.write()`` calls, which will cause partial data to be
  transmitted.

- Created a second test case instance for the post-mortem WSGI server, so it
  is tested as well.

- Using python's ``doctest`` module instead of deprecated
  ``zope.testing.doctest``.

3.8.0 (2010-08-05)
------------------

- Implemented correct server proxy behavior. The HTTP server would always add
  a "Server" and "Date" response header to the list of response headers
  regardless whether one had been set already. The HTTP 1.1 spec specifies
  that a proxy server must not modify the "Server" and "Date" header but add a
  "Via" header instead.

3.7.0 (2010-08-01)
------------------

- Implemented proxy support. Proxy requests contain a full URIs and the
  request parser used to throw that information away. Using
  ``urlparse.urlsplit()``, all pieces of the URL are recorded.

- The proxy acheme and netloc/hostname are exposed in the WSGI environment as
  ``zserver.proxy.scheme`` and ``zserver.proxy.host``.

- Made tests runnable via buildout again.

3.6.2 (2010-06-11)
------------------

- The log message "Exception during task" is no longer logged to the root
  logger but to zope.server.taskthreads.


3.6.1 (2009-10-07)
------------------

- Made tests pass with current zope.publisher which restricts redirects to the
  current host by default.


3.6.0 (2009-05-27)
------------------

- Moved some imports from test modules to their setUp to prevent
  failures when ZEO tests are run by the same testrunner

- Removed unused dependency on zope.deprecation.

- Remove old zpkg-related DEPENDENCIES.cfg file.


3.5.0 (2008-03-01)
------------------

- Improve package meta-data.

- Fix of 599 error on conflict error in request
  see: http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-dev/2008-January/030844.html

- Removed dependency on ZODB.


3.5.0a2 (2007-06-02)
--------------------

- Made WSGI server really WSGI-compliant by adding variables to the
  environment that are required by the spec.


3.5.0a1 (2007-06-02)
--------------------

- Added a factory and entry point for PasteDeploy.


3.4.3 (2008-08-18)
------------------

- Moved some imports from test modules to their setUp to prevent
  failures when ZEO tests are run by the same testrunner


3.4.2 (2008-02-02)
------------------

- Fix of 599 error on conflict error in request
  see: http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-dev/2008-January/030844.html

  environment that are required by the spec.


3.4.0 (2007-06-02)
------------------

- Removed an unused import. Unchanged otherwise.


3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
--------------------

- Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to zope.server
  from Zope 3.4.0a1

  environment that are required by the spec.
