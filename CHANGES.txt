0.7 (2012-01-11)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Default ``send_bytes`` value is now 18000 instead of 9000.  The larger
  default value prevents asyncore from needing to execute select so many
  times to serve large files, speeding up file serving by about 15%-20% or
  so.  This is probably only an optimization for LAN communications, and
  could slow things down across a WAN (due to higher TCP overhead), but we're
  likely to be behind a reverse proxy on a LAN anyway if in production.

- Added an (undocumented) profiling feature to the ``serve()`` command.

0.6.1 (2012-01-08)
------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Remove performance-sapping call to ``pull_trigger`` in the channel's
  ``write_soon`` method added mistakenly in 0.6.

0.6 (2012-01-07)
----------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- A logic error prevented the internal outbuf buffer of a channel from being
  flushed when the client could not accept the entire contents of the output
  buffer in a single succession of socket.send calls when the channel was in
  a "pending close" state.  The socket in such a case would be closed
  prematurely, sometimes resulting in partially delivered content.  This was
  discovered by a user using waitress behind an Nginx reverse proxy, which
  apparently is not always ready to receive data.  The symptom was that he
  received "half" of a large CSS file (110K) while serving content via
  waitress behind the proxy.

0.5 (2012-01-03)
----------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fix PATH_INFO encoding/decoding on Python 3 (as per PEP 3333, tunnel
  bytes-in-unicode-as-latin-1-after-unquoting).

0.4 (2012-01-02)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added "design" document to docs.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Set default ``connection_limit`` back to 100 for benefit of maximal
  platform compatibility.

- Normalize setting of ``last_activity`` during send.

- Minor resource cleanups during tests.

- Channel timeout cleanup was broken.

0.3 (2012-01-02)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Dont hang a thread up trying to send data to slow clients.

- Use self.logger to log socket errors instead of self.log_info (normalize).

- Remove pointless handle_error method from channel.

- Queue requests instead of tasks in a channel.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Expect: 100-continue responses were broken.


0.2 (2011-12-31)
----------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Set up logging by calling logging.basicConfig() when ``serve`` is called
  (show tracebacks and other warnings to console by default).

- Disallow WSGI applications to set "hop-by-hop" headers (Connection,
  Transfer-Encoding, etc).

- Don't treat 304 status responses specially in HTTP/1.1 mode.

- Remove out of date ``interfaces.py`` file.

- Normalize logging (all output is now sent to the ``waitress`` logger rather
  than in degenerate cases some output being sent directly to stderr).

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Support HTTP/1.1 ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked`` responses.

- Slightly better docs about logging.

0.1 (2011-12-30)
----------------

- Initial release.
