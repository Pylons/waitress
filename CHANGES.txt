1.0a2 (2016-07-07)
------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Removed `AI_ADDRCONFIG` from the call to `getaddrinfo`, this resolves an
  issue whereby `getaddrinfo` wouldn't return any addresses to `bind` to on
  hosts where there is no internet connection but localhost is requested to be
  bound to. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/131 for more
  information.

1.0a1 (2016-06-24)
------------------

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Python 2.6 is no longer supported.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Waitress is now able to listen on multiple sockets, including IPv4 and IPv6.
  Instead of passing in a host/port combination you now provide waitress with a
  space delineated list, and it will create as many sockets as required. Using
  the host/port combination is deprecated but will be supported for at least
  the next 5 minor releases.

  .. code-block:: python

	from waitress import serve
	serve(wsgiapp, listen='0.0.0.0:8080 [::]:9090 *:6543')

Security
~~~~~~~~

- Waitress will now drop HTTP headers that contain an underscore in the key
  when received from a client. This is to stop any possible underscore/dash
  conflation that may lead to security issues. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/80 and
  https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2015/jan/13/security/
