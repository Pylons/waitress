2.0.0b0 (2020-11-26)
--------------------

- Waitress no longer attempts to guess at what the ``server_name`` should be for
  a listen socket, instead it always use a new adjustment/argument named
  ``server_name``.

  Please see the documentation for ``server_name`` in
  https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/arguments.html and
  see https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/329

- Allow tasks to notice if the client disconnected.

  This inserts a callable ``waitress.client_disconnected`` into the environment
  that allows the task to check if the client disconnected while waiting for
  the response at strategic points in the execution and to cancel the
  operation.

  It requires setting the new adjustment ``channel_request_lookahead`` to a value
  larger than 0, which continues to read requests from a channel even if a
  request is already being processed on that channel, up to the given count,
  since a client disconnect is detected by reading from a readable socket and
  receiving an empty result.

  See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/310

- Drop Python 2.7, 3.5 support

- The server now issues warning output when it there are enough open
  connections (controlled by "connection_limit"), that it is no longer
  accepting new connections. This situation was previously difficult to
  diagnose.
