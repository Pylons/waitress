0.9.0 (2016-04-15)
------------------

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Python 3.2 is no longer supported by Waitress.

- Python 2.6 will no longer be supported by Waitress in future releases.

Security/Protections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Building on the changes made in pull request 117, add in checking for line
  feed/carriage return HTTP Response Splitting in the status line, as well as
  the key of a header. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/124 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/122.

- Waitress will no longer accept headers or status lines with
  newline/carriage returns in them, thereby disallowing HTTP Response
  Splitting. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/117 for
  more information, as well as
  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Response_Splitting.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- FileBasedBuffer and more important ReadOnlyFileBasedBuffer no longer report
  False when tested with bool(), instead always returning True, and becoming
  more iterator like.
  See: https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/82 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/76

- Call prune() on the output buffer at the end of a request so that it doesn't
  continue to grow without bounds. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/111 for more information.
